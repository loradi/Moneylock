//  Prompts.swift — bench corpus.
//
//  Four categories × a few prompts each. Categories chosen to expose where
//  each drafter shines or falls flat:
//  - code: expect Prompt Lookup / Suffix to hit on identifier repeats
//  - summary: expect Prompt Lookup to hit on input-quoting
//  - qa: mixed, tests when answer quotes prompt
//  - chat: novel text, should zero-out the string-matching drafters (sanity)
//
//  Keep prompts short so `maxTokens = 64–128` completes in reasonable time.
