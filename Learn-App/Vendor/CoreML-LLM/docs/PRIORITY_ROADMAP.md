# Priority Roadmap — Unified ranking of all speed candidates

Consolidated from 11 docs, ~70 candidates. Ranked by **ROI** (expected gain
÷ effort), filtered by **lossless** and **ANE-compatible**. Rejected items
listed at bottom with reason.

**Baseline**: 14.5 tok/s @ ctx=8192, iPhone 17 Pro (measured 2026-04-13).
**Goal**: 50+ tok/s @ 8K, lossless, pure ANE decode.

**Key reframing** (from Orion arXiv 2603.06728): ANE runs at 0.07% of peak
19 TFLOPS. INT8 == FP16 throughput. matmul ~3× slower than Conv1×1.
**Bottleneck is dispatch overhead, not compute or bandwidth.**

**2026-04-14 update:** MTP Path A extraction complete (Google's 44 MB drafter,
`output/mtp_probe/section_10.tflite`). L34 parity blocker **eliminated** as false
alarm (indexing artifact; our Gemma4Model matches HF at all 35 layers, rel
diff < 1e-5). Phase 2 now has **two parallel paths**: MTP (faster-to-ship,
no retraining) and EAGLE-3 (retrain required, Blocker 1 root cause now
understood — training-corpus KV-sharing mismatch, not a forward bug).

**2026-04-14 late:** MTP Path A end-to-end integration complete and deployed
to iPhone 17 Pro. **acc0 = 0 %** across all prompts — drafts never match
target. Runtime plumbing (verify chunks, write-through KV, per-step RoPE,
bootstrap, carry state) all verified working. Initial hypothesis blamed the
0.82 cosine TFLite↔PyTorch parity gap; **that hypothesis is wrong.** The
decisive test — running the raw TFLite drafter directly against HF Gemma 4
on Mac — also gets 0/5 argmax match. The drafter was trained against
LiteRT's W4A8-quantized target, whose L34 hidden and KV caches are not
numerically equivalent to HF's fp outputs. **MTP Path A is incompatible
with our HF target at the artifact level; no reimplementation fix exists.**
Details: `docs/MTP_INTEGRATION_RESULTS.md` §5. **Recommendation: fallback
to EAGLE-3 retrain (Track B) or self-trained MTP heads (Path C in
MTP_PATH_A_FINDINGS §7).**

---

## Phase 0 — Diagnostics & zero-risk micro-opts (< 1 day each)

Run these **now**, before any speculative or conversion work. They either
(a) price the rest of the roadmap or (b) are free throughput.

| # | What | Gain | Effort | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~**0a**~~ | ~~**MLComputePlan audit**~~ | **DONE (2026-04-13)** — chunk1-3 = 100% ANE. chunk4 = 8 CPU ops in InModelArgmax tail (~1-3% of step). Dispatch-overhead hypothesis confirmed. | — | V2 §G2, EXPERIMENTS.md |
| **0b** | **ANE pipeline prewarming** — 4× dummy predictions at load | first-token fix | 10 LoC Swift | V3 §B4 |
| ~~**0c**~~ | ~~**exp2 softmax**~~ | **REJECTED (2026-04-14)** — bundled in PR #17 and benched 5.5× slower on iPhone 17 Pro (see Phase 1 items 3/4/5b). | — | V3 §B1 |
| **0d** | **Prefill bypass** — skip chunk3+4 for N-1 prompt tokens (Q-only layers never produce KV) | TTFT −47% | 0.5 day Swift | ANE_SURVEY §1 |
| **0e** | **Output buffer pooling** — reuse MLMultiArray via NSCache | −1–2 ms/step | 0.5 day Swift | ANE_SURVEY |
| **0f** | **Ping-pong buffer audit** — 2-deep sync between consecutive chunks (ANE async safety) | correctness | 0.5 day | ANE_SURVEY (ANEMLL) |
| **0g** | **SRAM 32 MB working-set check** — tune prefillN per chunk to avoid 30% cliff | avoid 30% drop | 0.5 day analysis | SOURCES (Orion) |
| **0h** | **`reshapeFrequency = .infrequent` hint** (iOS 18.2+) — skip per-call shape-trace | ~0.5 ms/step | 0.5 day Swift | V6 §V6-1 |
| **0i** | **MLComputePlan warm-pool** — materialize plan once, reuse across predictions | ~0.8 ms first-call, cold-path shaves | 1 day Swift | V6 §V6-2 |

0a result: no compute-op fallback to fix. Bottleneck is 4× per-step
dispatch overhead, not per-op device placement.

---

## Phase 1 — Training-free micro-opts & refinements (1–2 weeks)

Ship without draft model. Most batchable in a single reconversion pass.

| Priority | What | Gain | Effort | Lossless | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~**1**~~ | ~~**W2A16 palettization**~~ | **REJECTED** — W2/W3 post-training = gibberish. QAT required. | — | — | FUND §3 |
| ~~**2**~~ | ~~**MLState stateful KV**~~ | **REJECTED** — `coreml_update_state` error -14 on ANE (Mac+iPhone). GPU-only. | — | — | FUND §2 |
| ~~**3**~~ | ~~**MLP tile reshape (B,C,8,8)**~~ | **REJECTED (2026-04-14)** — PR #17 | — | — | V3 §B2 |
| ~~**4**~~ | ~~**GQA broadcast matmul**~~ | **REJECTED (2026-04-14)** — PR #17 | — | — | V2 §G3 |
| **5** | **KV-share Q-batching** — stack L19/24/29/34 Q | ×1.08 | ~40 LoC | yes | SPEED P2.2 |
| ~~**5b**~~ | ~~**exp2 softmax**~~ | **REJECTED (2026-04-14)** — PR #17 | — | — | V3 §B1 |
| **5c** | **KV INT8 (TurboQuant)** — INT8 KV + fp16 residual window (128–256 recent) | 50% KV mem, long-ctx | 2–3 days | near (~0.1%) | SOURCES |
| **5d** | **Mixed-bit palettization (IQ style)** — embed/lm_head 6-bit, FFN 2–4-bit | 20–30% size or +quality | 1–2 days | near | SOURCES, LITERT_CONTAINER |
| **5e** | **SDPA fusion re-test** — iOS 18 native fused op may have fixed QK-norm scale=1.0 | 5–10% attn if fused | 1 day + reconvert | exact (if works) | ANE_SURVEY §4b |
| **5f** | **Draft & Verify (training-free self-spec)** — exit at L14 → LM head | ×1.5–2.0 | 2 days | yes | V5 |
| **5g** | **Kangaroo (lightweight adapter self-spec)** | ×1.68 | 2 days | yes | V5 |
| **5h** | **Blockwise-32 per-block W4 palettization** — coremltools 8.1 `granularity="per_block"` — strictly finer-grained than current per-channel | quality-neutral-or-+ | 1 day + reconvert | exact bits, lower quant error | V6 §V6-3 |
| **5i** | **SpinQuant / QuaRot rotation before palettization** — Hadamard rotation smears outliers so INT4 buckets cover less range | −0.3–0.5 PPL free | 2–3 days | near-lossless | V6 §V6-6 |

**PR #17 bench result (2026-04-14)**: items 3, 4, 5b bundled and reconverted.
8K baseline = 15.0 tok/s (c1=12.3, c2=20.7, c3=15.2, c4=17.3 ms). 8K with
PR #17 opts applied = 2.7 tok/s (c1=87.8, c2=143.8, c3=64.4, c4=67.3 ms) —
**5.5× slower across all four chunks**. Numerical parity held on Mac
(smoke tests cos > 0.99999), so the regression is on-device scheduling, not
correctness. Candidates for cause: MLP (B,C,8,8) tile falling off the ANE
fast path, `exp2` not actually ANE-native on A19 Pro, or the 5-D broadcast
matmul's intermediate blowing SRAM. Root-causing wasn't triaged since the
magnitude makes the combined change unsalvageable as-shipped; an ANE?
audit on the reconverted chunks would localise it if someone revisits.

**Phase 1 stack (conservative)**: 14.5 × 1.08 ≈ **15.7 tok/s** (KV-share
Q-batching alone; all reconversion-based opts rejected). Real path to 50+
requires Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 — Speculative decoding (THE critical path)

**Two parallel tracks. MTP is primary (no training, 3–4 days). EAGLE-3 is
fallback (needs Colab retrain, 3–5 days).** Q=K verifier + KV direct-write
serve both.

### Track A — MTP Path A (primary, fastest-to-ship)

| Priority | What | Gain | Effort | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **6A** | **PyTorch reimpl of Google drafter** — extract weights from TFLite | prereq | 1–2 days | MTP_PATH_A §4.2 |
| **7A** | **CoreML conversion (INT4, ~6–10 MB)** — mirrors build_eagle3.py | prereq | 1 day | MTP_PATH_A §4.3 |
| **8A** | **Swift `MtpDraftSource` wiring** — feeds on L34 tap (already exists) | prereq | 0.5 day | MTP_PATH_A §4.4 |
| **9A** | **On-device bench** — acceptance vs baseline | validation | 0.5 day | — |

Expected: **60–80% acceptance** (Google trained against reference fwd, no
distribution mismatch). **×1.3–1.6 direct**. Drafter 44 MB vs EAGLE-3 188 MB.
Primary unknown: `activations=(1,1,3072)` = 2×hidden — concat of `[hidden, ?]`
where `?` is either `embed(next_token)` or prev `projected_activations`.
Determined at start of 6A.

### Track B — EAGLE-3 retrain (fallback)

Blocker 1 root cause reframed (2026-04-14): training collected HF hidden
states with `use_cache=False` (no KV-sharing L15+); inference has KV-sharing
active. Retrain with `use_cache=True` traces should fix acceptance.

| Priority | What | Gain | Effort | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **6B** | **EAGLE-3 retrain** with correct forward-mode traces | fixes Blocker 1 | Colab 2–4 h | EAGLE3_STATE |
| **6C** | **DistillSpec** divergence-aware training (JSD/FKL/RKL) | +10–45% on retrained EAGLE-3 | +2–3 days GPU | SOURCES |
| **6D** | **HASS** — EAGLE train/infer mismatch fix, trains drafter against inference-mode target outputs (directly addresses Blocker 1's root cause) | +10–15% accept vs vanilla EAGLE | 1 A6000-day + 2 days | V6 §V6-7 |
| **6E** | **GliDe + CaPE** — drafter shares target's KV cache, zero drafter-side KV memory | drafter memory to ~0; verify-lossless | 4 days + ~8 A100-hours | V6 §V6-5 |
| **6F** | **Harmony-Decoding (HD)** — training-free self-speculative using target's own shallow layers with smart phase gate (not naive LayerSkip) | unmeasured on our weights | 6 days | V6 §V6-8 |
| **6G** | **Clover-2** — RNN drafter at 1/3 EAGLE params (smaller drafter = less ANE dispatch per spec step) | drafter ×0.33 size | 7 days + train | V6 §V6-9 |

### Shared infrastructure (both tracks need these)

| Priority | What | Gain | Effort | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **7** | **Q=K multi-function verifier** | enabling | 2 days | V2 §G1 |
| **8** | **In-model top-K** — argmax → topk(8) | enabling | 0.5 day + reconvert | V2 §G5 |
| **9** | **KV direct-write in commitAccepted** | fixes Blocker 2 | 1–2 days Swift | EAGLE3_STATE |
| **10** | **Sequoia (Y-tree) optimal topology** | +15–33% (e.g. 36→41.6 tok/s) | 1–2 days offline DP | V3 §A4, ANE_SURVEY |
| **11** | **Traversal Verification** | +10–20% | 0.5 day Swift | V3 §A5 |
| **11b** | **Verify chunks T=4** — Google uses T=3+1; extend our T=3 | K=4 capability | 0.5 day + reconvert | LITERT_CONTAINER |
| **11c** | **Verify-chunk write-through semantics (was: numerical tightening)** — v4 chain-mode bench (`docs/PHASE_B_V4_CHAIN_FINDINGS.md`) first framed this as batch-content fp16 sensitivity in `verify_qK`. **B.3 / PR #72 (2026-04-15) refuted that framing:** replacing batched `verify_qK` with K serial `decode_q1` did not close the chain gap (cross-vocab code stayed at 1.01 vs oracle 2.63; chat 2.31→2.09 within noise). The real mechanism is **semantic, not numerical** — verify writes drafter proposals into KV at positions P+1..P+K-1 *before* acceptance is decided, so subsequent target argmaxes condition on contaminated cache. Candidate fixes shrink to: **(a) output-space tolerance** in the acceptance test (Track A / PR #73 patch-ready — cheap measurement-only change) and **(b) verify-protocol redesign** to delay KV write-through until after acceptance (multi-week chunk re-export + Swift engine re-design). ~~fp32 upcast on the logit projection~~ and ~~accumulation-order-controlled re-quant~~ are **dead ends** — strict subsets of what PR #72 already removed. | **Phase C gating** | (a) ~1 day bench work after verify logits output lands; (b) multi-week | `docs/PHASE_C_TIGHTENING_FINDINGS.md`, `docs/PHASE_B_DECISION.md`, `docs/PHASE_B_V4_CHAIN_FINDINGS.md`, PR #72 |

### Track C — Zero-training auxiliaries (ship alongside A or B)

> **2026-04-15 demotion.** Items 14 and 14b (SuffixDecoding and
> Union-of-drafters) are no longer on the critical path. All
> speculative-decoding items are blocked downstream at item 11c
> (verify-protocol semantic redesign, multi-week) regardless of
> drafter choice — see `docs/PHASE_B_DECISION.md`. The ANE-native
> value-prop reframe (`docs/MOBILE_2K_COMPETITIVE_PLAN.md`) does
> not depend on speculation. Items 12/13/14/14b are retained as
> future options but are **not forecast inputs** for the 2K plan.

| Priority | What | Gain | Effort | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **12** | **Prompt Lookup Decoding** — algorithm merged in PR #36; wiring pending. Blocked on 11c. | ×2.4 (summaries/QA), 0× on chat | 0.5 day wiring | SOURCES, V6 §V6-4 |
| **13** | **Cross-vocabulary SD (Qwen 2.5 0.5B drafter)** — already bundled. Blocked on 11c. | ×1.5–2.5 | 3–4 days | V5 |
| ~~**14**~~ | ~~**SuffixDecoding**~~ — **DEMOTED 2026-04-15**. Blocked on 11c; net-regression live per PR #62 live-gap findings. Off critical path. | — | — | FUND §1 |
| ~~**14b**~~ | ~~**Union-of-drafters**~~ — **DEMOTED 2026-04-15**. Phase B Union shipped with defaults OFF (PR #54); v4 chain-mode refuted the original accept-rate projections; all Union variants need 11c first. Off critical path. | — | — | V6 §V6-11 |

**EAGLE-3 training targets (if Track B chosen)**: acc0 ≥ 50% → Q=K →
KV direct-write → **40–60 tok/s @ 2K, 25–35 tok/s @ 8K**.

## Phase 3 — Post-speculative optimizations

| Priority | What | Gain | Effort | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **15** | **Staged Speculative** — chunk1-2 as stage-1 draft | ×1.3–1.8 | 2 days | V3 §A6 |
| **16** | **Mirror SD** — NPU+GPU parallel | +30% over primary drafter | 2–3 days | UNEXP §B |
| **17** | **DISCO (dynamic speculation control)** — adaptive K | +10% free atop any spec | 1 day CPU-side | V5 |
| **18** | **SAM-Decoding (suffix automaton)** — O(n) space vs SuffixDecoding O(n²) | workload-dep | 2 days | V5 |
| **19** | **Lookahead Decoding (Jacobi trie)** — code-heavy workloads | ×2.66–6.26 code / ×1.5–2 chat | 3 days | V5 |
| **20** | **Speculative Streaming** — minimal-param n-gram | ×1.8–3.1 | 2–3 days | V5 |
| **21** | **ReDrafter RNN** — Apple's 1-layer drafter, 5–10 MB | ×2.3 | 3–4 days | ANE_SURVEY |

---

## Phase 4 — Attention & KV optimization (long-context quality)

| Priority | What | Gain | Effort | Lossless | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **22** | **DuoAttention** — retrieval vs streaming heads | ×1.50 | hours offline + chunk surgery | yes | SPEED A1 |
| **23** | **SparQ Attention** — fixed top-r sparse attention | ~16× BW on full-attn | 2 days + reconvert | near (~0.1%) | V3 §D1 |
| **24** | **Cascading KV Cache** — training-free 8K quality | 8K ≈ 2K cost | 2–3 days | near | UNEXP §C |
| **25** | **TransMLA** — post-training MLA retrofit | ×10.6 @ 93% KV | 2–3 days + QLoRA | near | V3 §D3 |
| **26** | **Residual/Lazy KV allocation** — PagedAttention concept adapted | memory on 8K | 1–2 days | yes | SOURCES |
| **27** | **Per-head-scaled INT8 KV** (llama.cpp-style, quality-safe variant of rejected naive INT8 KV) | KV ×0.5 mem (fp16 compute preserved) | 3 days | near | V6 §V6-10 |

---

## Phase 5 — UX & deployment

> **2026-04-15 update:** item 27 (GPU prefill) promoted from "stretch"
> to **Phase C critical path** under the ANE-native value-prop reframe.
> TTFT is one of the three value-prop axes in
> `docs/MOBILE_2K_COMPETITIVE_PLAN.md`; ~1 s TTFT is the projected
> win once item 27 ships. Effort revised up to 7–10 days (MLX-Swift
> is recent and underdocumented; original 1–2-day estimate was
> optimistic).
>
> **2026-04-15 late — sole critical-path decode-adjacent item.** The
> D1b chunk-pipelining projection (~43 tok/s via PR #77's
> compute-unit split) was retracted after PR #79 implemented the
> full 2-stage pipeline and measured −24 % on all 4 categories; the
> `c3 → c4` data dependency eliminates the within-step overlap
> window. See `docs/MOBILE_2K_COMPETITIVE_PLAN.md` §"Projection basis"
> and `docs/PHASE_B_DECISION.md` §"What this means for the
> go-forward target". With D1b invalidated, **item 27 is now the
> single critical-path decode-adjacent item** on this roadmap.

| Priority | What | Gain | Effort | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **27** ⭐ | **GPU prefill via MLX-Swift** — A19 Pro tensor cores; decode stays on ANE. **Phase C critical path** (TTFT axis of the ANE-native value prop). | TTFT 13s → ~1s (projection) | 7–10 days | UNEXP §A, MOBILE_2K_COMPETITIVE_PLAN §"Projection basis" |
| **28** | **Prefix KV caching** — persistent on disk | TTFT 4–35× on hit | 1 day Swift | UNEXP §E |
| **29** | **System Prompt KV cache (Ollama pattern)** — resume turns 2+ | TTFT ×2–5 on turn 2+ | 0.5 day | SOURCES |
| **30** | **Vocab pruning** — 262k → ~50k | −1.7 GB download | 1 day | UNEXP §D |
| **31** | **Multi-function weight dedup** (MultiFunctionDescriptor) | −50% disk on multi-fn | 1 day | ANE_SURVEY |

## Projected throughput path (updated 2026-04-14)

```
Baseline (measured)                    14.5 tok/s @ 8K

Phase 0: diagnostics + micro-opts
  MLComputePlan audit (DONE)           no fallback ops found
  Output pooling + prewarm (MERGED)    ×1.03  → 14.9
  Prefill bypass                       draft, decode-regression blocker

Phase 1: reconversion-based micro-opts
  PR #17 bundle (exp2 + MLP tile + GQA broadcast) REJECTED — 5.5× slower on device
  + KV-share Q-batching                ×1.08  → 16.1 (only remaining reconversion-free item)
  + KV INT8 (TurboQuant)               ×1.05  → 16.9  (mostly memory, small decode gain)

Phase 2A: MTP Path A (primary)
  + MTP drafter @ 65% acc              ×1.45  → 27.8
  + Q=K verifier + KV direct-write     ×1.30  → 36.2
  + Y-tree (Sequoia) topology          ×1.15  → 41.6

  Alternate Phase 2B: EAGLE-3 retrained
  + EAGLE-3 @ 50% acc                  ×2.0   → 36.4
  + Q=K + KV direct-write              ×1.3   → 47.3
  + Sequoia                            ×1.15  → 54.4

ANE overhead correction                ×0.85  → 35–46 tok/s
```

Conservative (MTP acc=55%, no Y-tree): **~28 tok/s @ 8K**.
Median (MTP acc=65% + Q=K + Y-tree): **~41 tok/s @ 8K**.
Upper bound (EAGLE-3 retrain + all optimizations): **~54 tok/s @ 8K**.

**Auxiliaries (Prompt Lookup, SuffixDecoding, DISCO) add 10–30% on top
for repetitive / long-prompt workloads.**

## Rejected (confirmed dead-ends)

| What | Why | Date |

### Status corrections (2026-04-14)

- **EAGLE-3 Blocker 1 (L34 parity)**: was a FALSE ALARM — indexing artifact
  in comparison harness. `output_hidden_states[35]` is post-norm, not L34
  raw. Our forward matches HF at all 35 layers (rel diff < 1e-5). Root
  cause of draft/target mismatch is training-time KV-sharing corpus
  (HF `use_cache=False` ≠ inference `use_cache=True`), not a forward bug.
- **EAGLE-3 Blocker 2 (KV direct-write)** remains critical. Current commit
  path re-runs T=1 decode per accepted token. Verify chunks v2 exist but
  not deployed.
- **MTP Path A** extraction DONE. `output/mtp_probe/section_10.tflite`,
  44.3 MB. Ready for PyTorch reimplementation.
