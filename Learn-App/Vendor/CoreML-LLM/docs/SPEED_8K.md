# 8K Context Speed — Exhaustive Research & Roadmap (v3)

**Status:** ctx=2048 ships at 31 tok/s · ctx=8192 = **14.9 tok/s on iPhone 17 Pro** (PR #7 per-chunk diag, 2026-04-13) · **chunk2 (7 full-attn layers) isolated as the 8K bottleneck at 20.7 ms / 2.96 ms-per-layer, 2× slower than sibling chunks (§0b)** · WFA rejected on quality · W8A8 rejected (ANE compile fails on iPhone) · **W2A16/W3A16 post-training rejected (gibberish; QAT required)** · EAGLE-3 benched on-device, not faster than baseline (distribution mismatch + commit re-runs decode; see `docs/EAGLE3_INTEGRATION_STATE.md`).
**Goal:** 8K @ 50+ tok/s *without quality loss*, with a documented path to 80+.
**Updated:** 2026-04-13. W2A16/W3A16 post-training palettization measured — complete quality collapse without QAT. See `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md`.


## Primary design principle: **ANE execution is the product**

This is a core objective, not just a means. All technique selection is filtered through "runs on ANE without CPU/GPU fallback" first, "quality preserved" second, "speed gain" third. Rationale:

- **Thermal**: ANE sustains 31 tok/s for 10+ min on iPhone 17 Pro. Competitors on GPU (MLX, MLC LLM) lose ~44% after thermal throttle.
- **Coexistence**: GPU stays free — users can run LLM alongside games, video editors, photo processing.
- **Energy**: ~0.07 J/tok (ANE) vs ~0.67 J/tok (GPU) — 10× more efficient.
- **App Store**: ANE is Apple's sanctioned path, zero App Store risk.
- **Moat**: we are the only ANE-native LLM library targeting iPhone with latest models. Losing ANE = commoditized to the MLX ecosystem.

Therefore this document rejects any proposal whose decode path requires CPU/GPU fallback, even if "faster in isolation."

## 0. Hard constraints (all confirmed)

| Constraint | Implication |
|---|---|
| ANE is FP16 internally | Weight-only INT quant = 0 speed gain (size-only). W8A8 opens INT8-INT8 path → 1.3-1.6× Apple-documented. |
| ANE SRAM 32 MB | KV is in DRAM anyway; SRAM spill risk only for intermediate softmax tensors. |
| Static shapes only | Use EnumeratedShapes (≤ 128 shapes, all ANE-eligible) for K / ctx / window variations. RangeDim falls back to GPU/CPU. |
| Manual-attention ceiling | SDPA fusion incompatible with Gemma4 QK-norm scale=1.0. |
| Current 8K KV: 48 MB | 7 full-attn layers × (1,1,8192,512) × fp16 × 2 ≈ 48 MB. Memory-bandwidth bound. |
| 4 chunked decode mlpackages | KV-share: L19/24/29/34 read kv14 (shared from L14). |

**Rejected outright:** SDPA fusion · naive WFA (quality NG past FW) · weight-only quant for speed · full GPU-only decode · Medusa (1.3% acc) · Self-speculative without pretraining (0% acc) · TurboQuant 3-bit KV (ANE forces FP16 decomp).

## 0b. Measured per-chunk breakdown — iPhone 17 Pro @ 8K (PR #7, 2026-04-13)

Steady-state (iter 3+) from `[Profile]` instrumentation in `ChunkedEngine.swift`:

| Component | ms | Layers | ms / layer | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| emb | 0.9 | — | — | |
| mask | **0.6** | — | — | pre-alloc PR #6 confirmed a no-op at this scale |
| chunk1 (L0-7, SWA) | 12.4 | 8 | 1.55 | |
| **chunk2 (L8-14, full-attn)** | **20.7** | **7** | **2.96** | **2× slower per layer than siblings — the 8K bottleneck** |
| chunk3 (L15-24, SWA) | 15.2 | 10 | 1.52 | |
| chunk4 (L25-34, SWA + LM head) | 17.3 | 10 | 1.73 | |
| sum chunks | 65.7 | 35 | — | |
| total | 67.0 | — | — | **14.9 tok/s** |

**Interpretation.** chunk2 holds all 7 full-attention layers (L8-14). Each reads `(1,1,8192,512)` × fp16 KV = ~8 MB per layer = ~56 MB per step just for K+V reads. That's the bandwidth-bound hot path that constraint "Current 8K KV: 48 MB" in §0 is warning about — now directly measured.

**Stacked ceiling if chunk2 alone is halved / quartered** (other chunks unchanged):

| chunk2 cost | sum chunks | total | tok/s | vs 14.9 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 20.7 (baseline) | 65.7 | 67.0 | 14.9 | 1.00× |
| 10.3 (½) | 55.3 | 56.6 | 17.7 | 1.19× |
| 6.9 (⅓) | 51.9 | 53.2 | 18.8 | 1.27× |
| 5.2 (¼) | 50.2 | 51.5 | 19.4 | 1.30× |

Even quartering chunk2 only gets ~19 tok/s. To reach the §2 target of 34 tok/s, chunk2 alone isn't enough — either chunk2 must drop near-zero AND the other chunks shrink (EAGLE-3 batches multiple steps per chunk call), OR a speculative / multi-step gain multiplies on top.

**Next action when this session is resumed.** Target chunk2 with a full-attention-layer-specific bandwidth reduction. Three viable approaches, ordered by ROI × implementation cost:

1. **DuoAttention on the 7 full-attn layers only** (Tier A, training-free after offline head classification). Gemma 4 E2B has `num_heads=8` per full-attn layer → classify which heads need full KV vs streaming-window. If ~50% fall to streaming, chunk2 KV halves → ~10 ms → ~18 tok/s. Code in `docs/SPEED_8K.md §1 A1` + Phase 3 of `docs/EAGLE3_INTEGRATION_STATE.md` has the pipeline sketch. Start at `conversion/identify_retrieval_heads.py` (already scaffolded) and `conversion/models/gemma4_swa_chunks.py` (per-head KV budget wiring).
2. **Block-static TriForce / Quest retrieval on the 7 full-attn layers** (§1 A3/A4). Higher ceiling (~¼ KV read) but needs the block-static top-k redesign to stay ANE. Not started.
3. **WFA (windowed full attention) on the 7 full-attn layers** (shelved in `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md` for quality regression) — the bandwidth win is proven (chunk2 collapses to SWA-class ~1.5 ms/layer ≈ 10 ms), but quality past the window is unrecoverable without DuoAttention-style per-head classification. Only viable combined with #1.

All three target *the same 7 layers inside chunk2*. Whichever lands, the Swift side needs no change — chunk2.mlpackage gets rebuilt with the new attention variant and dropped in. The instrumentation to confirm impact is already in place (PR #7 `[Profile]` will show chunk2 ms drop directly).

## 1. 2026 state of the art — compatibility matrix

Sorted by ANE feasibility × quality-preservation × ROI. All numbers are from cited papers on GPU; ANE-equivalent will be lower (typically 0.6-0.8× of GPU speedup), noted where applicable.

### Tier A — Training-free, ANE-implementable, big wins (stack these)

#### A1. DuoAttention (ICLR 2025, MIT HAN Lab) — retrieval vs streaming heads
- **Idea**: ~50% of attention heads in a GQA model are "retrieval heads" (need full KV), the other 50% are "streaming heads" (only need fixed-length sink+window).
- **Cost to deploy**: one-shot *optimization-based* pass on synthetic data (~hours on A100) to classify heads. Inference is fully training-free — just load the head mask.
- **Published numbers (Llama-3 GQA)**: 1.65× memory, **1.50× decode speedup**, quality preserved.
- **ANE mapping**: KV per head is already per-head; streaming heads just compile with a smaller (fixed) KV buffer. Fits our chunked pipeline and EnumeratedShapes cleanly.
- **Expected for Gemma 4 E2B @ 8K**: **15 → ~22 tok/s**, 40% KV memory saved, zero quality loss.
- **Source**: [mit-han-lab/duo-attention](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/duo-attention) · [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10819)

#### A2. KIVI — 2-bit KV quantization (ICML 2024) — **REJECTED for ANE**
- **Idea**: per-channel for Key, per-token for Value, symmetric INT2. Zero fine-tune.
- **Numbers (GPU)**: 2.6× memory, **2.35-3.47× throughput**, <2% accuracy loss on Llama/Mistral.
- **ANE reality (measured)**: KV-only INT8 gives **~0 speedup on ANE** because the ANE compute pipeline is FP16-internal and CoreML dequantizes INT8 KV to FP16 before the matmul. The theoretical DRAM→SRAM bandwidth halving does NOT materialize as wall-clock speedup on ANE. Confirmed by our bench session.
- **W8A8 also fails on ANE** (see Tier D below): `linear_quantize_activations` quantize/dequantize MIL ops cause `ANECCompile() FAILED` on iPhone 17 Pro. No INT8 path works on ANE as of iOS 26 / coremltools 9.0.
- **Conclusion**: skip all KV/activation quantization on ANE. Speedup must come from algorithmic changes (speculative decoding, sparse attention), not precision changes.
- **Source**: [jy-yuan/KIVI](https://github.com/jy-yuan/KIVI) (GPU-focused)

#### A3. TriForce — self-speculative with sparse KV draft (MLSys 2025)
- **Idea**: draft = **same target weights** with top-k *retrieved* KV (e.g., 2K out of 8K), target = full 8K. Losslessly verifies.
- **Numbers**: 97.6% acceptance with 1K sparse tokens out of 128K. **7.78× end-to-end at 128K**. At 8K you'd use ~512-1024 top-k out of 8K → expected acceptance 95%+ → ~2-2.5× speedup.
- **Training-free.** GQA support emerging (Llama-3.1 confirmed).
- **ANE catch**: top-k selection is dynamic; workaround is **block-level top-k with fixed budget** (select top-16 blocks of size 32 = fixed 512 tokens every time). This is ANE-compilable via EnumeratedShapes or static gather-indices.
- **Hierarchical mode**: EAGLE-3 small draft (60% acceptance) → TriForce sparse target (verify 3 tokens) → full target (verify any rejects). Triple-tier if we get brave.
- **Expected @ 8K**: 15 × ~2.2 = **33 tok/s** solo, or **compounds with EAGLE-3**.
- **Source**: [TriForce project](https://infini-ai-lab.github.io/TriForce/) · [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11912)

#### A4. Quest — query-aware sparse KV (ICML 2024)
- **Idea**: keep per-block min/max keys, estimate block criticality via Q @ [min,max], attend only to top-K blocks.
- **Numbers**: **7.03× self-attention**, 2.23× end-to-end latency, training-free.
- **ANE catch**: dynamic top-K like TriForce. Same fixed-block-budget workaround.
- **Expected @ 8K**: 15 → ~22-27 tok/s solo.
- **Overlap with TriForce**: TriForce is a superset (same retrieval idea + hierarchical speculation). Pick one — **TriForce preferred** because it composes with EAGLE-3.
- **Source**: [mit-han-lab/Quest](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/Quest)

#### A5. MiniCache — layer-depth KV merging (NeurIPS 2024)
- **Idea**: middle-to-deep layers have high KV similarity across adjacent layers. Merge them (magnitude + direction decomposition). Training-free.
- **Numbers**: 5× compression, **~5× throughput** on ShareGPT for Llama-2.
- **Our situation**: Gemma 4 **already KV-shares L15-34 to L13/L14 structurally**. MiniCache would merge *projections'* outputs across adjacent layers, not replace the existing sharing. Orthogonal.
- **Expected compound gain on top of existing sharing**: likely modest (much of the depth redundancy is already claimed). ~1.1-1.2× plausible.

#### A6. InfLLM — training-free block memory (NeurIPS 2024)
- **Idea**: past KV into blocks, pick block representatives, attend to top-k block reps.
- **Practical on ANE**: yes, with static block count and top-k budget.
- **Overlap**: subsumed by TriForce / Quest functionally. Skip.

### Tier B — Training-free, benefit uncertain / less composable

- **SnapKV** (prompt-eviction, great for long prompts but we're at 8K ctx not 32K — marginal).
- **PyramidKV** (pyramid budget per layer, for >64K prompts — overkill).
- **NACL / AdaKV / ChunkKV / KVMerger / MorphKV / Expected Attention / RocketKV / RetroAttention** — all KV-compression variants; pick best-of-breed after ablation. `NVIDIA/kvpress` has a standardized benchmark of 20+ methods — **consult it before implementing**.
- **Mamba / Jamba / Samba / Zamba hybrid SSM**: architectural rewrite, non-starter for our Gemma 4 retrofit. Flag for v1.0+ if we do our own model.

### Tier C — Quality-preserving but require fine-tune (days on GPU)

- **StreamingLLM + QLoRA recovery**: sink=4 + window=2048 for full-attn layers, fine-tune for long-ctx. Closes the WFA quality gap.
- **MHA → MLA retrofit (MHA2MLA, ACL 2025)**: 4-14% KV size, better perplexity than GQA. v0.6+ candidate.
- **LayerSkip**: needs pretraining.

### Tier D — Apple-specific levers

- **~~W8A8 with real calibration~~** — **REJECTED (2026-04-13)**. Built W4A8 (INT4 weights + INT8 activations) with proper 16-sample calibration pipeline (`build_w8a8_all.py` + `coremltools_tmp_cleanup.py`). Mac Studio M4 Max: compiles and runs but **0% speedup** (ANE still runs FP16 internally). **iPhone 17 Pro: `ANECCompile() FAILED`** — the `quantize`/`dequantize` MIL ops inserted by `coremltools.optimize.coreml.linear_quantize_activations` are not compilable by the iPhone ANE compiler. Tested with clean file push (no file-mismatch), error reproducible. Apple's ResNet50 INT8 claim may only apply to models built with Apple's internal training pipeline, not coremltools post-training quantization. **Dead end.**
- **EnumeratedShapes {2048, 8192}**: single mlpackage, ANE-safe for all shapes. Ship "fast mode" (2K) + "long mode" (8K) under one binary.
- **Prefix caching / persistent KV**: for repeated system prompts. **4-35× TTFT on cache hits at 1-4K, up to 136× at 32K** (safetensors-based, survives reboot). Not decode throughput but huge UX win.
- **A19 Pro GPU tensor cores** (Metal Performance Primitives, Xcode 26.1+): 7.5 TFLOPS FP16 / 13.5 TOPS INT8. Argmax-bench: 2.5-3.1× vs A18 Pro GPU. **Route prefill (compute-bound) to GPU**; keep decode (bandwidth-bound) on ANE.
- **Apple Recurrent Drafter (ReDrafter)**: Apple's own draft architecture — RNN-based + dynamic tree attention + target-model distillation. 2.3× on Apple Silicon MLX. Basis of iOS 26's 48.77M / 3.18B ratio. **EAGLE-3 is equivalent or better per recent benchmarks** — no need to switch.
- **Apple Mirror Speculative Decoding (2026 research)**: bidirectional speculation, **NPU+GPU parallel execution**, 30% better than EAGLE-3 on server. Implementation on iPhone ANE+GPU is the Apple-blessed parallel path. Worth watching; paper's focus is 14-66B server models but the NPU+GPU split idea is transferable.

## 1b. ANE-compatibility verdict per technique

| Technique | ANE decode path? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-alloc masks/RoPE | ✅ pure ANE | Swift-only buffer reuse, ANE graph unchanged |
| KV-share Q-batching | ✅ pure ANE | Just widens matmul Q dim |
| INT8 KV cache | ❌ ANE-incompatible | CoreML dequantizes INT8 KV to FP16 before ANE compute. Bandwidth halving doesn't materialize. |
| W8A8 | ❌ ANE-incompatible | coremltools `linear_quantize_activations` emits MIL quant/dequant ops the iPhone ANE compiler rejects. See `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md`. |
| DuoAttention | ✅ pure ANE | head classification offline; runtime uses 2 static KV banks |
| EAGLE-3 draft + verify | ✅ pure ANE | small decoder layer, EnumeratedShapes for K=1/3 |
| StreamingLLM + QLoRA | ✅ pure ANE (after FT) | standard attention post-fine-tune |
| MHA → MLA retrofit | ✅ pure ANE (after retrain) | latent projection matmul |
| MiniCache | ✅ pure ANE | merged KV = standard tensor |
| Prefix caching | ✅ pure ANE | just I/O, ANE graph unchanged |
| **TriForce / Quest** | ⚠️ **partial** | dynamic top-K → CPU/GPU fallback risk; needs block-static redesign to stay ANE |
| A19 Pro GPU tensor cores (decode) | ❌ violates ANE goal | *But* prefill-only route is acceptable |
| Mamba / SSM hybrid | ❌ unproven on ANE | selective scan not yet ported |
| Orion / private ANE API | ❌ App Store incompatible | research only |

**Stack preference: everything in ✅ rows, TriForce only if it can be made static-shape block-level, nothing from ❌.**

## 2. Recommended stack for 8K — honest expected throughput

Stacked sequentially (each factor applies to the current baseline):

```
             step-speedup    cumulative tok/s @ 8K
baseline                     15
+ pre-alloc masks      ×1.00     15     ← measured ~0% on 2K; mask-fill was already sub-ms
+ KV-share Q-batch     ×1.08     16
+ DuoAttention (A1)    ×1.50     24     ← quality preserved, training-free
+ EAGLE-3 (in train)   ×2.00     48     ← fully lossless via verify
```

**Pre-alloc** (PR #6) is kept as a cleanup, not a speedup — mask/RoPE prep wasn't on the hot path at 2K. May still help at 8K where masks are 4× larger; not re-measured.

**W8A8 removed from the stack**: coremltools `linear_quantize_activations` inserts MIL quant/dequant ops the iPhone ANE compiler rejects. See `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md` for the dead-end write-up.

**INT8 KV / KIVI removed from the stack**: same ANE-compiler rejection as W8A8, plus CoreML dequantizes to FP16 before ANE compute. No int8-int8 fast path is reachable on ANE today.

**Conservative pessimism adjustment (ANE overhead, non-linear compounding)**: multiply final by 0.70 → **~34 tok/s @ 8K** is the realistic landing zone.

Alternative path replacing EAGLE-3 with TriForce hierarchical:
```
+ TriForce (sparse draft + full verify)  ×2.3 → ~80 tok/s
+ EAGLE-3 on top of TriForce (3-tier)    ×1.3 → ~105 tok/s   (research territory)
```

For perspective:
- Apple's own 3B on iOS 26 reports 2-4× from draft-model speculative. We're in the same league.
- MLX-based 7B LLMs on M4 Max see ~45 tok/s. Beating 60 tok/s @ 8K for a 2.7B on iPhone ANE is at or above industry SOTA.

## 3. Execution order (updated)

### Parallel track P1 — EAGLE-3 (already running)
On Colab, 2 epochs × 30k corpus, acc0 tracking 52% @ 7%. Finish, deploy, measure on iPhone. **Deliverable**: ctx=2048 at 55-70 tok/s, ctx=8192 at ~30 tok/s.

> **Status snapshot 2026-04-12**: the `acc0 52% @ 7%` figure is from the most recent `train_eagle_draft.ipynb` / `train_eagle3_draft.ipynb` run (both untracked — the notebooks are still iterated in Colab). Before quoting this number elsewhere, open the latest notebook output cell and verify it still holds. The data-prep and hidden-state collection pipeline is tracked: `conversion/download_eagle_corpus.py` + `conversion/collect_eagle_hidden_states.py`. CoreML export of the draft model goes through `conversion/build_speculative.py` (modified, not yet merged). See `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md` for the abandoned Medusa comparison that motivated choosing EAGLE-3.

### Parallel track P2 — ANE bandwidth reduction (training-free, fastest ROI)
1. ~~**Pre-allocate masks/umask/RoPE**~~ — landed (PR #6) but measured no-op (§0b). Mask-fill was already sub-ms. Kept for cleanup.
2. **KV-share Q-batching** for L19/24/29/34 in `gemma4_swa_chunks.py:140` (~40 LoC). Still applicable; targets chunk3/4 shared-KV reads.
3. ~~**INT8 KV cache**~~ — rejected: coremltools dequantizes to FP16 before ANE compute (§1b). No bandwidth win on ANE.
4. **chunk2 bandwidth reduction (NEW priority)** — the measured 8K bottleneck (§0b: 20.7 ms, 2.96 ms/layer). See §0b "Next action" for the three candidates (DuoAttention heads / block-static TriForce / WFA+DuoAttention combo). Target: chunk2 → ≤10 ms.

### Parallel track P3 — DuoAttention head identification
1. Port DuoAttention training script to Gemma 4 E2B (setup: BookSum data, ~4-8h on A100).
2. Produce head classification (~50% retrieval, ~50% streaming).
3. Modify `gemma4_swa_chunks.py` to use streaming-window KV for streaming heads while keeping full KV on retrieval heads. Per-layer per-head budget known at build time → ANE-compilable.

### Parallel track P4 — W8A8 calibration pipeline
1. Real prefill+decode traces on 128-512 Gemma-chat-formatted prompts, seq=2048.
2. `coremltools.experimental.linear_quantize_activations` → then `linear_quantize_weights` (INT4 palettized) → final W4A8 mlpackage.
3. Validate on Mac Studio before iPhone bring-up.

### Sequential track S1 — after P3 lands: TriForce or advanced sparse
Once DuoAttention is in, consider TriForce as a natural extension (it uses the same head-wise KV idea at the sequence dimension). Hierarchical mode with EAGLE-3 is the upper bound.

### Track T1 — Apple-blessed path (lower priority unless the 3B model becomes the product)
Foundation Models framework (iOS 26) ships Apple's 3.18B + ReDrafter. For Gemma 4 E2B specifically, we can't piggyback — but for *UX wins* we can use persistent KV / prefix caching patterns regardless of model.
