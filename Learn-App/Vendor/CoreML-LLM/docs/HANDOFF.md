# Next-session handoff

**Last updated:** 2026-04-24 (N=1024 prefill attempt + latent KV-write
bug discovered + rolled back).

**Most recent session summary:** `docs/SESSION_2026_04_24.md` — read
that first, then `SESSION_2026_04_23.md`. Supersedes the "next steps"
below for TTFT levers; decode optimization items still apply.

## 1-minute summary

CoreML-LLM ships Gemma 4 E2B at **31 tok/s decode on iPhone 17 Pro**
(ANE, ~1 W, ~1 GB). That decode rate is the **hard ANE ceiling** on
the current chunk graph — every avenue to raise it has been tried and
failed. The sole remaining high-impact lever is **TTFT** (13 s → ~1 s
via GPU prefill). That is the current focus.

## What was tried and why it failed

### Speculative decoding — ALL paths dead

| Drafter | Result | Root cause |
|---|---|---|
| EAGLE-3 (trained) | 0 % acc on device | Trained against HF `use_cache=False` hidden states; inference uses `use_cache=True` → distribution mismatch |
| MTP Path A (Google TFLite extraction) | 0 % acc | Drafter trained against LiteRT W4A8 target, incompatible with our HF fp target |
| MTP Path C (self-trained K=2) | 16 tok/s (baseline 31) | acc0=17 % live, below 40 % break-even |
| Cross-vocab Qwen 2.5 0.5B | 1.8 tok/s on iPhone | 10× below projection; Qwen forward too slow on ANE |
| Prompt Lookup (n=2, n=3) | Net regression 3/4 categories | Chain-mode acceptance below break-even |
| SuffixDecoding | T1=18 % | Workload-dependent; insufficient for primary drafter |
| Union of all above | 15–21 tok/s (baseline 32) | All components regress; defaults OFF on main |

**Common blocker across all drafters:** verify writes drafter proposals
into the KV cache at positions P+1..P+K-1 **before** acceptance is
decided. Subsequent target argmaxes condition on contaminated cache.
This is structural — PR #72 proved it's semantic (not fp16 numerical).
Fixing it requires either K=1 verify (zero speedup) or fundamentally
better drafters (60 %+ acc) so contamination rarely triggers. Our best
drafter hits 38 %. Google's works because their MTP is 60-80 % against
their own quantized target.

### Decode-side non-speculative — all dead

| Approach | Result | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D1b chunk pipelining (ANE+GPU split) | −24 % all categories | c3→c4 strict data dep; only ~1 µs overlap window |
| ANE parallelism (PR #75) | 0 % gain | ANE driver serialises all submissions |
| INTEGRATED_ROADMAP conversion opts (softmax swap, FusedQKV, NCHW, etc.) | No effect | coremltools 9 already applies these passes internally |
| PR #17 micro-opts (MLP tile, GQA broadcast, exp2) | 5.5× slower | Ops fell off ANE fast path |
| MLState stateful KV | error −14 | ANE compiler rejects `coreml_update_state`; GPU-only. Confirmed still broken on iOS 26. |
| W8A8 activation quant | ANECCompile() FAILED | iPhone ANE compiler rejects quantize/dequantize MIL ops |
| W2/W3 post-training palettization | Complete gibberish | Requires QAT (multi-day GPU), not post-training |
| LayerSkip at L14 | 0/60 match (0.0%) | chunk3 (L15-24) skip produces random tokens; L14 hidden is useless without refinement. Measured 2026-04-16 via `LAYERSKIP_PROBE=1`. |

### Why 32 tok/s is the hard ceiling

The bottleneck is **4 serial ANE dispatches per token** at ~13 ms each
(~51 ms/step). ANE peak utilisation is 0.07 % — compute and bandwidth
are not the constraint. Dispatch count is. The only ways past this are:

1. Fewer chunks (2-chunk variant prototyped but ANE compiler stability
   concerns; being explored in a separate session)
2. Speculative decoding (all paths blocked, see above)
3. A future Apple OS/API change

None of these are on the current critical path.

## What is alive

### Round 8 decode-side leads (2026-04-26) — **3 candidates for parallel sessions**

`docs/ROUND8_FINDINGS.md` documents three drafter-excluded decode levers
ranked by ROI, all single-function (no multifunction PTQ constraint),
all dependency-free for parallel session execution:

| Branch | Candidate | Effort | Effect (decode) |
|---|---|---|---:|
| ~~`feat/joint-int8-lut`~~ | ~~Joint compression: INT8 LUT entries~~ | — | **DEAD 2026-04-26** Mac probe (`SESSION_2026_04_26_ROUND8_INT8_LUT_PROBE.md`): ANE -6.2pt, latency +3.4 %, cos 0.83 |
| `feat/joint-sparse-palettized` | Joint sparse + palettized POC (`COREMLTOOLS_AND_IOS18.md` §7.4) | 2-3 days | binary, 0 or significant |
| `feat/palu-low-rank-kv` | PALU low-rank K/V projection (arXiv 2407.21118, ICLR 2025) | 4-6 days | **+5-8 tok/s** |

**PALU is the highest-effect new lead.** Read `ROUND8_FINDINGS.md`
before claiming a branch.

### GPU prefill via MLX-Swift (item 27) — **CURRENT FOCUS**

| Axis | Current | Projected |
|---|---|---|
| TTFT @ 512 prompt | ~13 s (ANE prefill) | **~1 s** (GPU tensor cores) |
| Decode tok/s | 31 | 31 (unchanged — decode stays on ANE) |
| Power during prefill | ~1 W | Brief GPU spike, then back to ~1 W |

Prefill is compute-bound (512 × 1536 × 1536 × 35 layers ≈ 42 GFLOPS).
A19 Pro GPU tensor cores at 50 % utilisation = 3.75 TFLOPS → ~11 ms.
ANE does ~66 ms. 6× speedup on prefill path alone.

Implementation: compile prefill chunks with `.cpuAndGPU`, decode chunks
stay on `.cpuAndNeuralEngine`. Swift fast-switches based on batch size.
Weights shared — no double download.

Effort: 7–10 days. No training, no calibration.

**Mac measurement (2026-04-16, PR #86):** GPU prefill on Mac Studio
was 9.7× slower than ANE (278 ms → 2697 ms). This is expected — Mac
GPU goes through Metal/CoreML overhead without tensor cores. The
target is iPhone A19 Pro GPU with tensor cores (3.75 TFLOPS). Decode
regression: none (33.0 → 32.9 tok/s). iPhone measurement pending.

### Video multimodal — Phase 2

PR #84 (video placeholder token fix) is OPEN. Phase 2 native encoder
conversion is documented in `docs/VIDEO_PHASE2_CONTINUATION.md` but
not started.

### CPU/thermal — investigation closed (2026-04-18)

Hypothesis "device feels hotter than LiteRT-LM because CPU
orchestration around ANE saturates a P-core" was **refuted by E4B
device measurement**: `cpu_active=3.0ms (4% CPU)`, `ANE_wait=68.7ms`.
ANE is busy 97% of step time and that's the actual heat source. The
1 W ANE the docs claim is correct; what makes it feel hot is *sustained
dispatch keeping ANE pinned at high DVFS for 14 seconds per response*.

Shipped (PR #98): `LLM_FAST_PREDICTION` (default ON, iOS 18+
specializationStrategy), `LLM_DECODE_QOS`, `LLM_PROFILE_EVERY_STEP`,
`[ANE/CPU]` log line, tethered powermetrics + Mac smoke scripts.

Tried and removed: `LLM_DOUBLE_BUFFER_KV` — IOSurface-backed
MLMultiArray gets locked when used as model input and cannot be reused
as output backing in subsequent inferences (Apple-side limit, not
fixable in our pipeline). 16× slowdown observed on iPhone before
removal. Documented in `CPU_BOTTLENECK_INVESTIGATION.md` so the path
isn't re-attempted.

Remaining headroom is **conversion-side only**:
- 2-chunk merge: tested 2026-04-17, +2% E2B (CHUNK_CONSOLIDATION_BENCH).
  E4B 21+21 likely past ANE compiler ceiling — 14+14+14 (3-chunk) is
  the safer experiment.
- W2-QAT: only large remaining lever (~50% DRAM bandwidth → ~50% DRAM
  heat). Multi-day GPU training. Apple FM 3.18B uses this recipe.
- GPU path with ML Drift-style fusion: separate effort, "LiteRT route".

## Key numbers

- iPhone 17 Pro 2K baseline: **31.4 tok/s** decode, **~154 tok/s** prefill
- Per-chunk decode: c1=5.9 c2=6.8 c3=8.1 c4=10.4 ms
- ANE placement: 99.78 % (7,294/7,310 ops)
- Memory: ~1 GB `phys_footprint`
- LiteRT-LM iOS: 56 tok/s (Metal GPU, 3–5 W) — different axis, not a target

## Docs landscape (for future sessions)

The authoritative docs are:

| Doc | What it is |
|---|---|
| **This file** | Start here |
| `CPU_BOTTLENECK_INVESTIGATION.md` | 2026-04-18 thermal investigation — confirms ANE itself is the heat source (CPU is 4% busy). Decision rules + iPhone checklist. |
| `MOBILE_2K_COMPETITIVE_PLAN.md` | Value prop (power + TTFT + 32 tok/s) |
| `BASELINE_SPEED_AUDIT.md` | Per-chunk cost breakdown |
| `SESSION_STATE.md` | PR/branch state (stale after 4/15; this file is newer) |

Key investigation chains (the contributing docs are still in `docs/`):

- **Spec decoding refutation:** PHASE_A5 → PHASE_B_LIVE_ACCEPT_RATE_GAP → V3_ARGMAX → V4_CHAIN → PHASE_C_TIGHTENING → PHASE_B_DECISION
- **MTP/EAGLE refutation:** MTP_INTEGRATION_RESULTS → MTP_PATH_C_FINDINGS → EAGLE3_INTEGRATION_STATE
- **CPU/thermal refutation:** CPU_BOTTLENECK_INVESTIGATION (CPU is idle, ANE dispatch density isn't the lever; W2-QAT is the only large remaining headroom)
