## Executive Summary

Five findings that directly change our roadmap:

1. **Blocker 2 is solved by design.** Google's verify pass runs ALL K+1 tokens through
   the full model in a single forward pass. The model's internal `dynamic_update_slice`
   writes KV for all positions (accepted AND rejected). Rejected tokens' KV entries
   are harmlessly masked out by the attention mask. **No separate KV commit step is
   needed.** Our existing verify_chunk T=3 architecture already does this — we just
   need to advance the position counter by `num_accepted + 1` after verification.
   (See B1.3)

2. **K=3 is fixed, not dynamic.** Google generates exactly 3 draft tokens per MTP cycle
   (derived from the verify signature's input_pos shape = 4 = K+1). No adaptive
   speculation, no early-exit from the drafting loop. Simple greedy argmax comparison
   for acceptance. This is much simpler than DISCO or other dynamic-K schemes.
   (See B1.1, B1.2)

3. **KV cache architecture: slices + update model on NPU, in-place on CPU/GPU.**
   The NPU executor externalizes KV cache updates into a separate TFLite model
   (cache_update signatures) because NPU can't do dynamic_update_slice efficiently.
   For CPU/GPU, the model does in-place updates via dynamic_update_slice — identical
   to our CoreML chunks. **Our ANE path needs no restructuring.** (See B1.3, B2)

4. **No MTP in the export pipeline.** The ai-edge-torch repo has zero references to
   MTP, drafter, or speculative decoding. The MTP drafter is trained/exported
   separately (likely Google-internal). The export pipeline for the base model uses
   standard HuggingFace loading with minimal patches (RMSNorm → HLFB composite only).
   (See C1)

5. **UINT2 quantization is real — Google uses 2-bit weights for 60% of FFN layers.**
   Deep graph inspection reveals a split architecture: L0-14 use INT4 everywhere,
   but L15-34 use **UINT2 weights with 2× wider FFN** (12288 vs 6144 intermediate).
   Same byte budget, more parameters. The LM head is also UINT2. Activations are
   INT8 per-tensor throughout (W4A8 for L0-14, W2A8 for L15-34). This is far more
   aggressive than our uniform INT4 palettization. (See A2)

6. **20 layers share a single KV cache.** L15-34 have Q-only attention — they only
   project queries, reading K/V from kv_cache_13 (SWA) and kv_cache_14 (full attn).
   This is how Gemma 4 achieves 35 layers with only 15 KV cache entries. (See A3)

## Part A — Model Graph

### A1. Section Inventory & Chunk Boundaries

(From LITERT_CONTAINER_ANALYSIS.md, confirmed)

| Section | Size (MB) | Type | Description |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 0 | 103.8 | Embedder | `token_ids (1,1) → embeddings (1,1,1536)` |
| 1 | 1284.5 | Per-layer embedder | `token_ids (1,1) → embeddings (1,1,35,256)` PLE |
| 2 | 94.1 | Vision encoder | SigLIP image encoder |
| 3 | 9.5 | Vision post-proc | Post-encoder projection |
| 4 | 0.0 | Empty | Placeholder |
| 5 | 219.1 | Vision preprocessor | Image feature extraction |
| 6 | 4.7 | MM projector | Multimodal projection |
| 7 | 0.0 | Empty | Placeholder |
| 8 | 818.3 | **Main LLM** | Full 35-layer transformer, 4 signatures |
| 9 | 44.3 | **MTP drafter** | 4-layer mini-transformer |

**Critical difference from our approach:** Google ships the LLM as a **single 818 MB
TFLite** (section 8) with 4 signatures (decode, prefill_128, prefill_1024, verify_4).
We split into 4 chunks for ANE dispatch. This is an ANE-specific optimization — Google
doesn't need it for XNNPACK CPU.

**Chunk boundaries (ours vs Google's):**

| Our chunks | Layers | Google |
|---|---|---|
| chunk1 (L0-7, SWA) | 8 layers | All in section 8 |
| chunk2 (L8-14, full-attn) | 7 layers | All in section 8 |
| chunk3 (L15-24, SWA) | 10 layers | All in section 8 |
| chunk4 (L25-34, SWA + LM head) | 10 layers | All in section 8 |

**LLM Signatures (section 8):**
- `decode`: T=1, single token decode
- `prefill_1024`: T=1024, large batch prefill
- `prefill_128`: T=128, medium batch prefill
- `verify_4`: T=4, verify 3 draft tokens + current token

### A2. Quantization Strategy

**MAJOR FINDING: Split architecture with UINT2 for 60% of FFN layers.**

Deep TFLite graph inspection of section 8 reveals two distinct layer groups with
dramatically different quantization:

**Layers 0-14 (15 layers with own KV cache — "KV layers"):**

| Component | Bit-width | Shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| q_proj | INT4 per-channel | [2048,1536] (SWA) / [4096,1536] (full) | 8 heads |
| k_proj | INT4 per-channel | [256,1536] (SWA) / [512,1536] (full) | 1 KV head |
| v_proj | INT4 per-channel | [256,1536] / [512,1536] | 1 KV head |
| o_proj | INT4 per-channel | [1536,2048] / [1536,4096] | |
| gate1/gate2 | INT4 per-channel | [6144,1536] | intermediate=6144 |
| down_proj | INT4 per-channel | [1536,6144] | |

**Layers 15-34 (20 layers sharing KV — "Q-only layers"):**

| Component | Bit-width | Shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| q_proj | INT4 per-channel | [2048,1536] | Q-only, no K/V projections |
| k_proj | **NONE** | — | Reads from kv_cache_13/14 |
| v_proj | **NONE** | — | Reads from kv_cache_13/14 |
| o_proj | INT4 per-channel | [1536,2048] | |
| gate1/gate2 | **UINT2** per-channel | [**12288**,1536] | **2× wider FFN** |
| down_proj | **UINT2** per-channel | [1536,**12288**] | **2× wider FFN** |

**LM head:** UINT2 per-channel, [262144,1536], 96.0 MB. Logit softcapping at 30.0.

**PLE (Per-Layer Embedding) weights:** INT8 gate [256,1536] + INT8 projection [1536,256]

**Width-for-bits trade:** L15-34 use UINT2 (2-bit) with 2× intermediate size (12288 vs
6144). The byte budget is identical to INT4 with 6144, but the model gets more
parameters through wider networks. This is "overparameterize then compress."

**Activation quantization:** Per-tensor INT8 throughout. Every FC input goes through
FP32→INT8 quantization, every FC output through INT8→FP32 dequantization. This
makes the pipeline **W4A8 for L0-14** and **W2A8 for L15-34**.

**All quantization is symmetric** (zero_point=0) and **per-channel** (one scale per
output channel).

**Comparison to ours:** We use uniform INT4 palettization across all weights. Google's
approach is far more aggressive — UINT2 for the majority of FFN compute. CoreML's
`coremltools` does not support UINT2, but we could approximate with INT4 at 2× width
or explore custom quantization tables. The key question is whether ANE supports UINT2
decompression efficiently.

**Weight size breakdown:**

| Category | Size (MB) |
|---|---|
| Attention (q/k/v/o) all layers | 132.8 |
| FFN (gate1/gate2/down) all layers | 472.5 |
| PLE weights | 26.2 |
| LM head | 96.0 |
| Norms/constants | 1.3 |
| **Total** | **~729** |

### A3. Attention Implementation

**GQA: 8:1 ratio, no explicit repeat.**
- SWA layers: Q=[1,1,8,256] (8 heads, head_dim=256), K/V=[1,1,1,256] (1 KV head)
- Full layers: Q=[1,1,8,512] (8 heads, head_dim=512), K/V=[1,1,1,512] (1 KV head)
- **No explicit repeat_interleave** — the matmul handles GQA broadcasting implicitly
  via composite subgraph calls (`STABLEHLO_SHIFT_RIGHT_LOGICAL` dispatches to
  `runtime_bmm.impl_*` subgraphs)

**Q·K attention matmul — two distinct implementations:**

*SWA Q·K (subgraph `runtime_bmm.impl_0`):*
- Extracts a **1535-element sliding window slice** from the INT8 KV cache
- Dequantizes the slice INT8→FP32
- Performs batch matmul
- Writes result into padded [1,1,8192,32003] via `DYNAMIC_UPDATE_SLICE`
- 13 ops total: compute window bounds, slice, dequant, matmul, scatter

*Full attention Q·K (subgraph `runtime_bmm.impl_1042_0`):*
- Dequantizes the **entire** K cache INT8→FP32
- Full matmul against all context positions
- Only 2 ops: DEQUANTIZE + matmul

**Softmax:** Standard SOFTMAX op (code 25). **No exp2 optimization.** No fused SDPA.

**RoPE:** Precomputed frequency tables baked as FP32 constants:
- SWA: `[1,1,128]` table (head_dim/2=128)
- Full: `[1,1,256]` table (head_dim/2=256)
- At runtime: `input_pos * freq_table` → sin/cos → apply to Q halves
- NPU path: separate auxiliary model with `decode_rope`/`prefill_rope_*` signatures

**KV cache layout (matches ours):**
- K: `(1, 1, 32003, head_dim)` — seq before head_dim
- V: `(1, 1, head_dim, 32003)` — transposed, head_dim before seq
- INT8 quantized, per-tensor scale, ZP=0
- V-transposed layout avoids runtime transposes for attn·V

**SWA vs full attention differentiation:**
- SWA layers (L0-3, L5-8, L10-13): head_dim=256, own kv_cache entries
- Full layers (L4, L9, L14): head_dim=512, own kv_cache entries
- SWA mask: dynamically computed range check `[pos - window, pos)`
- Full mask: externally provided decode_mask broadcast to all 8 heads

**KV sharing (L15-34):** These 20 layers have **Q-only attention** — they project
queries but read K/V directly from `kv_cache_k_13` (SWA) and `kv_cache_k_14`
(full). No K/V projections exist in these layers. This is how Gemma 4 achieves
35 layers of context with only 15 KV cache entries.

**Sparse attention:** No sparse attention patterns exist for full-attention layers.
The full-attention Q·K subgraph (`runtime_bmm.impl_1042_0`) dequantizes the
**entire** K cache and performs a dense matmul against all 32003 context positions.
No block-sparse, top-k retrieval, or TriForce-style eviction is applied.

**Op code remapping (Google-internal):** Google repurposes TFLite op codes:
- `STABLEHLO_SHIFT_RIGHT_LOGICAL` → composite subgraph call dispatcher
- `MEAN` → sin, `TANH` → cos (for RoPE)
- `AVERAGE_POOL_2D` → concatenation
- `SQUARED_DIFFERENCE` → slice
These are dispatched to custom subgraph implementations at runtime.

### A4. FFN / MLP Implementation

**GeGLU activation lowering (L0-14, INT4, intermediate=6144):**
```
FC:         INT8[1,1,1536] * INT4[6144,1536] → INT8[1,1,6144]   # gate1
DEQUANT:    INT8[1,1,6144] → FP32[1,1,6144]
FC:         INT8[1,1,1536] * INT4[6144,1536] → INT8[1,1,6144]   # gate2
DEQUANT:    INT8[1,1,6144] → FP32[1,1,6144]
GELU:       FP32[1,1,6144] → FP32[1,1,6144]                     # gelu(gate1)
MUL:        FP32 * FP32 → FP32                                   # gelu(gate1)*gate2
QUANT:      FP32 → INT8 (per-tensor)                             # re-quantize
FC:         INT8[1,1,6144] * INT4[1536,6144] → INT8[1,1,1536]   # down_proj
DEQUANT:    INT8[1,1,1536] → FP32[1,1,1536]
```

**GeGLU activation lowering (L15-34, UINT2, intermediate=12288):**
```
FC:         INT8[1,1,1536] * UINT2[12288,1536] → INT8[1,1,12288]  # gate1
FC:         INT8[1,1,1536] * UINT2[12288,1536] → INT8[1,1,12288]  # gate2
GELU + MUL
FC:         INT8[1,1,12288] * UINT2[1536,12288] → INT8[1,1,1536]  # down
```

Key observations:
- **No fused GeGLU op** — GELU and MUL are separate elementwise operations
- TFLite has a **native GELU op** (code 150) — not decomposed to tanh approximation
- **Activation quantization at every FC boundary:** FP32→INT8 (per-tensor, scale, ZP=0)
  before each FC, INT8→FP32 after. This is full W4A8/W2A8 dynamic quantization.
- **No tiling tricks** (no reshape to (B,C,8,8) pattern)

**PLE (Per-Layer Embedding) sub-block — present in EVERY layer:**
```
FC:   INT8[1,1,1536] * INT8[256,1536] → INT8[1,1,256]     # PLE gate
GELU: gelu(gate_output)
MUL:  gelu_output * per_layer_embedding[layer_i]            # element-wise gate
FC:   INT8[1,1,256] * INT8[1536,256] → INT8[1,1,1536]     # PLE projection
ADD:  residual + PLE_output
```
This is the Gemma 4 Per-Layer Embedding mechanism — each layer gets a gated
injection of its own learned embedding. PLE runs AFTER attention, BEFORE FFN.

**RMSNorm fusion:** `odml.rms_norm` StableHLO composite wraps pow+mean+rsqrt+mul.

### A5. LM Head

- **Location:** Inside section 8 (main LLM), last 4 ops of decode subgraph.
- **Quantization:** **UINT2** per-channel, [262144, 1536], 96.0 MB.
  262,144 quantization scales (one per vocab entry). Symmetric (ZP=0).
- **Output:** Full logit vector `(1, T, 262144)` as FP32.
  **No in-model argmax/topk** — sampling done externally by Sampler.
- **Logit softcapping:** `MUL(1/30)` → FC → `MUL(30)` — softcapping at 30.0.
  The LM head is the **only FC that takes FP32 activations directly** (no INT8
  quantization of the input), preserving precision for the final projection.
- **Weight tying: CONFIRMED.** Byte-identical data between embedding table
  (section 0) and LM head (section 8). Same UINT2 dtype, same per-channel
  scales. Stored as separate copies (no deduplication in the container).
- **Verify output:** `(1, 4, 262144)` logits + `(1, 4, 1536)` activations
  for all 4 positions. The activations output is the pre-norm hidden state
  (same tensor that feeds the MTP drafter).

## Part B — Runtime

### B1. Speculative Loop & KV Commit (CRITICAL)

**Overview of the MTP speculative cycle:**

```
Step 1: [First cycle only] Run normal decode (T=1)
        → get token + activations from last layer
        
Step 2: Run drafter 3× sequentially
        → Each step: embed(token) ++ projected_activations → drafter model
        → Get 3 draft tokens [d1, d2, d3]

Step 3: Run verifier (T=4) with [good_token, d1, d2, d3]
        → Full model forward on all 4 tokens
        → Get logits[4] + activations[4] + KV written for all 4 positions

Step 4: Greedy rejection sampling
        → Compare verifier argmax[i] vs draft[i] for i=0..2
        → Accept prefix, bonus = first mismatch or verifier[3]

Step 5: KV commit (NPU only): run cache_update model
        → CPU/GPU: no-op (verify already wrote KV via dynamic_update_slice)

Step 6: Save activation at last_accepted position → carry state for next cycle
        → Next cycle can skip Step 1 entirely
```

**File references:**
- GPU MTP drafter: `runtime/executor/llm_litert_mtp_drafter.cc`
- NPU MTP loop: `runtime/executor/llm_litert_npu_compiled_model_executor.cc:1556-1691`
- Rejection sampling: `llm_litert_npu_compiled_model_executor.cc:2422-2462`
- KV commit: `llm_litert_npu_compiled_model_executor.cc:2464-2491`

#### B1.1 Draft Token Count K

**K=3 is fixed**, derived from the verify signature's `input_pos` tensor shape:
```cpp
// llm_litert_mtp_drafter.cc:240
num_draft_steps = input_pos_dims[0] - 1;  // verify_4 → input_pos=[4] → K=3
```

No dynamic K. No early-exit from the drafting loop. No fallback when acceptance
rate drops. The loop always runs exactly 3 draft steps.

**The 56.5 tok/s figure at ~60% acceptance rate means:**
- Base decode: ~20 tok/s (estimated)
- With MTP K=3: expected speedup = 1/(1 + 1/3) * (1 + 0.6*3) ≈ 2.1× to 2.8×
- 20 × 2.8 ≈ 56 tok/s — consistent with observed performance

#### B1.2 Verify → Accept → Reject Flow

**GPU path** (`llm_litert_mtp_drafter.cc:486-516`):
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < num_draft_steps_; ++i) {
    if (verifier_id_vector[i] != drafted_tokens[i]) {
        bonus_token = verifier_id_vector[i];
        break;
    }
    num_correct_tokens++;
}
if (bonus_token == -1) {
    bonus_token = verifier_id_vector[num_draft_steps_];
}
```

Simple greedy argmax comparison — NOT probabilistic rejection sampling. This is
deterministic and produces identical results to standard autoregressive decoding
(for greedy/argmax sampling).

**NPU path** (`llm_litert_npu_compiled_model_executor.cc:2438-2461`):
Identical logic using `GetLogitsAtBatchIndex` to sample from batch logits.

#### B1.3 KV Cache Update After Acceptance — BLOCKER 2 RESOLUTION

**THIS IS THE KEY FINDING.**

Two different mechanisms depending on backend:

**GPU/CPU path (our equivalent):**
The verify signature runs ALL K+1 tokens through the full model. The model contains
`dynamic_update_slice` ops that write KV entries at positions [P, P+1, P+2, P+3].
**ALL positions are written, including rejected ones.** After partial acceptance:
- Position counter advances by `num_accepted + 1` (for bonus token)
- Stale KV entries at positions beyond the counter are masked out by the attention mask
- No cleanup, no rollback, no separate commit step

**This means our CoreML verify chunks already solve Blocker 2!** The verify_chunk
models with T=3 run the full model on K+1 tokens, which writes KV via their internal
`dynamic_update_slice`. After acceptance, we simply advance the position counter.
The stale entries are invisible to future attention computations because the mask
only covers positions ≤ current_step.

**NPU path (not relevant to us but documented for completeness):**
The NPU can't efficiently do `dynamic_update_slice`, so the LLM outputs KV "slices"
(small tensors for current tokens only). A separate `cache_update` auxiliary model
copies these slices into the full KV cache. The `CommitVerifiedKVCache` function
(`llm_litert_npu_compiled_model_executor.cc:2464-2491`) runs this auxiliary model
with position indices `[start_step, start_step+1, ..., start_step+T-1]`.

**Implication:** Our CoreML/ANE pipeline behaves like Google's CPU/GPU path — the
model does in-place KV updates. No restructuring needed. Blocker 2 is dissolved.

#### B1.4 Carry State (Activations Bootstrap)

The verifier outputs `activations` at all K+1 positions. After acceptance, the
activation at the last accepted position is extracted and used as the carry state
for the next MTP cycle:

```cpp
// llm_litert_npu_compiled_model_executor.cc:1646-1661
size_t hidden_size_in_bytes = full_activations.size() / dratfer_seq_len;
memcpy(last_verify_activations_.data(),
       full_activations.data() + rs_result.num_accepted * hidden_size_in_bytes,
       hidden_size_in_bytes);
has_valid_verify_activations_ = true;
```

On the next cycle, this skips the initial decode step entirely — the drafter
starts from the saved activation. Our verify chunks already output
`activations` (the last hidden state) which can be used identically.

**For the MTP drafter's input:** `activations = concat(embed(token), projected_activations)`
- First half (1536 dims): raw embedding of the token (NO sqrt(H) scaling)
- Second half (1536 dims): either the target's last hidden state (step 0) or
  the drafter's own `projected_activations` output (steps 1+)

### B2. KV Cache Management

**GPU/CPU: Double-buffer with pointer swap.**
Two `flat_hash_map<string_view, TensorBuffer>` maps (`kv_cache_buffers_1_`,
`kv_cache_buffers_2_`) with `input_kv_cache_buffers_` and `output_kv_cache_buffers_`
pointer aliases. After each model run:
```cpp
// llm_litert_compiled_model_executor.cc:766
std::swap(input_kv_cache_buffers_, output_kv_cache_buffers_);
```

**GPU single-buffer optimization:** When `gpu_optimized_single_buffer_cache_` is true,
the same buffer serves as both input and output. A `param_tensor` with
`[start_index, end_index, end_index]` tells the kernel where to write. No swap needed.

**NPU: Full cache + slices + cache_update model.**
LLM outputs small KV slice tensors. Separate `cache_update` signatures
(`decode_cache_update`, `prefill_cache_update_128`, `verify_cache_update`) copy
slices into the full cache at specified positions.

**KV sharing with drafter:** The MTP drafter reads the target model's `kv_cache_k_13`
and `kv_cache_k_14` directly via `TensorBuffer::Duplicate()` (shared memory handles).
No separate drafter KV cache.

**Sliding window eviction:** StreamingLLM-style token deletion via
`DeleteTokensFromKvCache`:
- Drops `num_tokens_to_drop` tokens while retaining `init_tokens_to_retain` initial tokens
- K axis 2, V axis 3 (consistent with transposed-V layout)
- No ring buffer — simple shift/drop operation

**Full-attention KV eviction:** No eviction or compression strategy exists for
full-attention layers. The cache shape is hard-capped at 32003 positions. The
`DeleteTokensFromKvCache` function applies only to SWA cache layers. Full-attention
layers (L4, L9, L14) grow monotonically until the 32003 cap is reached.
At max context, the runtime does not evict, compress, or page full-attention KV —
inference simply operates with the full cache.

**INT8 KV cache:** All KV caches are INT8 quantized. The dequantization is handled
at the model level (DEQUANTIZE op in the TFLite graph).

**Memory reuse between prefill and decode:** Prefill and decode share the same
physical KV cache buffer allocations — both signatures reference the same
`input_kv_cache_buffers` / `output_kv_cache_buffers` maps. No buffer reallocation
or memory reclamation occurs at the prefill→decode transition. The double-buffer
swap is a pointer swap, not a copy. For the dynamic executor, KV cache grows
incrementally by `kv_increment_size` (default 16 tokens) via `ResizeTensorBuffer`.

### B3. Prefill vs Decode

**Separate signatures, not parameterized:**
- `prefill_128` / `prefill_1024`: Q=128/1024 tokens
- `decode`: Q=1 token
- `verify_4`: Q=4 tokens (K+1)

**Chunked prefill:** Yes. The static executor splits prefill into chunks matching
available signatures using `GetOptimizedPrefillWorkGroups`. Multiple chunks are
run sequentially. The dynamic executor supports `prefill_chunk_size` parameter.

**Backend consistency:** Same compiled model for all signatures (prefill, decode,
verify). No backend switching between phases.

**NPU decode pipeline (per token):**
1. Embedder (token → embedding)
2. Per-Layer Embedder (token → per-layer embedding) [Gemma 4 specific]
3. RoPE computation (auxiliary model)
4. Mask computation (auxiliary model)
5. LLM forward (main model, decode signature)
6. Cache update (auxiliary model)
7. Sampling

Each step is a separate TFLite model invocation. This decomposition is NPU-specific;
the CPU/GPU path runs embedder + LLM as two models with in-model RoPE/mask.

### B4. Model Loading & Session Management

**Cold start optimization:**
- Compiled model caching: GPU backends cache compiled shaders/kernels
  (`cache_dir` + `cache_compiled_shaders_only`)
- Warmup inference: explicit `WarmupInference` and `WarmupDrafterInference` methods
  run dummy inference on all signatures before actual use
- Weight upload: GPU has `convert_weights_on_gpu` + `wait_for_weight_uploads` options

**Section loading:** Lazy via `ModelResources::GetTFLiteModel(ModelType)`. Models are
memory-mapped (physical memory allocated on demand). Model types:
- `kTfLitePrefillDecode` (main LLM)
- `kTfLiteEmbedder` (token embedding)
- `kTfLitePerLayerEmbedder` (PLE)
- `kTfLiteAux` (RoPE, mask, cache update)
- `kTfLiteMtpDrafter` (MTP drafter)
- `kTfLiteMtpAux` (drafter's RoPE/mask)

**Session state:**
- One session per executor (enforced via `occupied_executors_` set)
- Checkpoint save/restore for KV cache rewind
- Clone for branching conversations (deep copy KV cache)

### B5. Thermal / Performance Management

**No runtime thermal management.** Zero throttling, adaptive behavior, token rate
monitoring, or backend switching under load in the open-source runtime code.

**GPU priority control:** Two flags for UI smoothness (not thermal):
- `gpu_context_low_priority`: Low-priority GPU context
- `hint_kernel_batch_size`: Periodic GPU command flush (e.g., every 4 ops)

**MTP statistics tracked:**
```cpp
struct LatencyStats {
    int mtp_num_draft_tokens = 0;
    int mtp_num_accepted_tokens = 0;
};
```

On executor destruction, acceptance rate is logged:
```cpp
ABSL_LOG(INFO) << "Success rate: " << (double)num_verified / num_drafted;
```

Purely observational — no runtime adaptation based on these metrics.

## Part C — Export Pipeline

### C1. Gemma 4 Model Definition

**Key finding: Google does NOT re-author Gemma 4.** They load the HuggingFace
`transformers` model directly and monkey-patch specific components:

```python
# export_lib.py:114-192
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.float32)
config._attn_implementation = 'lrt_transposed_attention'
```

**Gemma 4 patches (`model_ext/gemma4/patch.py`):**
Only one patch: Replace `Gemma4RMSNorm` with a version using StableHLO composite
HLFB (`odml.rms_norm`). This wraps the entire norm into a single fusible op.

**SWA / Full attention interleaving:** Handled by HuggingFace's `config.layer_types`
(values: `"sliding_attention"`, `"full_attention"`). The export pipeline reads this
to create separate masks and cache configurations per layer type.

**KV cache sharing (`model_ext/gemma4/cache.py:92-130`):**
Gemma 4 has `num_kv_shared_layers` where later layers share KV with earlier layers.
The `LiteRTCacheForGemma4` class:
- Creates only `num_hidden_layers - num_kv_shared_layers` unique cache layers
- Inserts dummy references for shared layers before inference
- Strips back to unique layers for I/O

**Only unique KV layers appear in model I/O.** Shared layers point to the same cache.

**Per-Layer Embedding (PLE):** Exported as a separate TFLite model (section 1).
Shape: `[batch, seq_len, num_hidden_layers, hidden_size_per_layer_input]`.
This is a Gemma 4-specific feature — per-layer input modulation.

**MTP drafter:** NOT in the ai-edge-torch export pipeline. Zero references to
MTP, drafter, or speculative decoding. The drafter is trained/exported separately
(likely Google-internal tooling).

### C2. Quantization Recipes

**Default recipe: `dynamic_wi8_afp32`**
- INT8 weight-only, FP32 activations, dynamic range
- Per-channel (channelwise) quantization
- Applied post-conversion via `ai_edge_quantizer`
- No calibration data — purely min/max based

**Mixed-bit per component (via `GenerativeQuantRecipe`):**
```python
GenerativeQuantRecipe(
    default=create_layer_quant_fp16(),
    attention=create_layer_quant_dynamic(Dtype.INT8, Granularity.CHANNELWISE),
    feedforward=create_layer_quant_dynamic(Dtype.INT4, Granularity.BLOCKWISE_128),
)
```

Supported granularities for INT4: BLOCKWISE_32, BLOCKWISE_64, BLOCKWISE_128, BLOCKWISE_256.

**Per-component regex matching:**
- Attention: `transformer_block/litert_torch.generative.layers.attention`
- FFN: `transformer_block/litert_torch.generative.layers.feed_forward`
- Per-block overrides supported via `{idx: LayerQuantRecipe}` dict

### C3. Conversion Passes

**Pipeline (`export_lib.py:234-356`):**
1. `torch.export.export()` — PyTorch 2 export
2. Decomposition passes (pre-lower + TFLite-specific)
3. `converter.convert()` — FX graph → TFLite via StableHLO
4. `mu_pass_lib.update_model()` — fuses sum+mul → mean
5. Mixed precision: FP16 conversion, keeping RMSNorm + Add in FP32
6. Quantization: post-conversion via `ai_edge_quantizer`

**StableHLO composites (fused ops):**

| Composite | Usage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `odml.rms_norm` | All RMSNorm layers | pow+mean+rsqrt+mul → single op |
| `odml.scaled_dot_product_attention` | Available but NOT used | HF path uses transposed attention instead |
| `litert_torch::bmm_4d` | Q·K and attn·V | `stablehlo.dot_general` with batch dims [0,1] |

**KV cache as model I/O:** Flattened into model inputs/outputs via PyTorch pytree
registration. Each layer's K and V are separate tensors (`k_0`, `v_0`, `k_1`, `v_1`...).
Cache updates use `tfl.dynamic_update_slice`. Stateful I/O, not internal state.

**Transposed KV layout optimization:**
- K: `[1, BK, S, H]` (seq at dim 2) — natural for Q·K^T
- V: `[1, BK, H, S]` (seq at dim 3) — natural for attn·V
- Avoids all runtime transposes. Matches our existing layout.

**EnumeratedShapes:** Multiple fixed prefill lengths (`prefill_256`, `prefill_512`,
etc.) as separate signatures. Decode always has input length 1. Verify has fixed
length K+1=4.

---

## Implications for CoreML-LLM

### Blocker 2: DISSOLVED

**What we thought:** After accepting draft tokens, we need to "commit" their KV
entries without re-running the full model. We assumed this required a separate
KV write mechanism.

**What Google does:** The verify pass IS the commit. The model runs all K+1 tokens
through the full forward pass, which naturally computes and writes KV for all
positions via `dynamic_update_slice`. After partial acceptance, rejected tokens'
KV entries sit in the cache at positions beyond `current_step`, invisible to
the attention mask.

**What we need to do:** Nothing architectural. Our verify_chunk T=3 models already
run K+1 tokens through the full pipeline. After verification:
1. Advance `current_step` by `num_accepted + 1`
2. Extract `activations` at the last accepted position for carry state
3. Done. Stale KV entries are masked out.

**Reference:** `EAGLE3_INTEGRATION_STATE.md` §Blockers — Blocker 2 ("commit re-runs
decode per accepted token") is no longer a blocker. The verify pass already writes
all needed KV.

### MTP vs EAGLE-3: Strategy Decision

| Factor | Google MTP | Our EAGLE-3 |
|---|---|---|
| Drafter size | 44 MB (4 layers) | 188 MB (47M params) |
| Training | Pre-trained by Google | Custom train, Blocker 1 (distribution mismatch) |
| Acceptance | Unknown (est. 60%+ from 56.5 tok/s) | 0% on-device (forward-mode mismatch) |
| KV dependence | Reads target kv13/kv14 directly | Needs hidden taps at L8/L17/L34 |
| Runtime | 3 sequential drafter calls + 1 verify | 1 draft call + 1 verify |
| Verifier | Same verify chunks, reusable | Same verify chunks, reusable |

**Recommendation:** Proceed with MTP Path A (extract Google's drafter). It's smaller,
pre-trained against Google's reference forward (no Blocker 1), and the verify
infrastructure is already built.

### Quantization: UINT2 Width-for-Bits Trade

Google's actual model is far more aggressive than we assumed:
- L0-14: INT4 attention + INT4 FFN (intermediate=6144)
- L15-34: INT4 attention + **UINT2 FFN** (intermediate=**12288**)
- LM head: **UINT2** [262144,1536]
- Activations: **INT8 per-tensor** at every FC boundary (W4A8 / W2A8)

The width-for-bits trade (2× wider at UINT2 = same bytes as 1× at INT4) is a
novel compression strategy. CoreML's `coremltools` does not support UINT2 natively.

**Options for our pipeline:**
1. **INT4 at 2× width** — approximate the W2A8 layers by using INT4 with expanded
   intermediate size (12288). This doubles model size for those layers but may
   improve quality. ANE should handle the wider matmuls.
2. **Custom 2-bit lookup tables** — palettize to 4 values (2 bits), which
   `coremltools` palettization supports via `nbits=2` in `OpPalettizerConfig`.
3. **Keep uniform INT4** — simpler, proven to work on ANE, and Google's UINT2
   quality may not transfer to our pipeline without their training recipe.

**Recommended first step:** Test 2-bit palettization on L15-34 FFN weights using
`coremltools.optimize.coreml.palettize_weights(nbits=2)` and measure perplexity.

### What Confirms Our Approach

1. **KV cache layout** — K=(1,heads,ctx,hd), V=(1,heads,hd,ctx) matches exactly
2. **Transposed V** — Google uses the same V-transposed layout we adopted
3. **INT8 KV cache** — Google quantizes KV cache to INT8
4. **Separate embedder** — externalized embedding lookup, same as our `EmbeddingLookup.swift`
5. **Chunked prefill** — breaking long prompts into fixed-size chunks
6. **No SDPA fusion** — manual attention, same as us
7. **Precomputed RoPE** — baked into model or separate computation, not runtime

### What We Should Adopt

1. **Per-Layer Embedding (PLE)** — Present in EVERY layer of Google's model, with
   gated injection of per-layer learned embeddings (INT8, 256-dim bottleneck).
   PLE is a 1284 MB section (section 1) — larger than the LLM itself. This
   suggests it's architecturally important, not optional. **Must investigate
   whether correct inference requires PLE or if it's quality-only.**

2. **Warmup inference** — Google explicitly warms up all models before actual inference.
   Maps to our `ANE pipeline prewarming` (Priority 0b). Should be 4× dummy predictions.

3. **Verify activation extraction** — Save the verifier's hidden state at the last
   accepted position to bootstrap the next MTP cycle without re-running decode.
   This is ~free once we have the verify output.

4. **W4A8 / activation quantization** — Google quantizes activations to INT8 at every
   FC boundary (per-tensor, symmetric). On XNNPACK this enables INT8×INT4 kernels.
   On ANE, `coremltools` W8A8 was rejected (compile fails), but W4A16 with FP16
   activations is our current path. Worth revisiting if Apple adds W4A8 support.

### What Invalidates an Assumption

1. **No dynamic K** — We assumed more complex speculation strategies (DISCO) might be
   needed. Google's fixed K=3 with simple greedy acceptance achieves 56.5 tok/s.
   Simplicity wins.

2. **No thermal adaptation** — We assumed Google had runtime thermal management
   contributing to sustained performance. They don't. Their 56.5 tok/s is raw
   compute throughput from efficient XNNPACK CPU kernels + MTP speculation.

3. **EAGLE-3 Blocker 1 cause confirmed** — The export pipeline uses
   `_attn_implementation = 'lrt_transposed_attention'` which differs from HF's
   default. EAGLE-3 was trained against HF's default attention, explaining the
   distribution mismatch.

4. **Quantization is far more aggressive than we assumed.** We thought Google used
   INT8 everywhere. They actually use UINT2 for 60% of FFN compute and the LM head.
   The "width-for-bits" trade (2× wider intermediate at UINT2) is a novel compression
   strategy we hadn't considered. This may explain part of the speed advantage —
   UINT2 weights mean half the memory bandwidth vs INT4.

5. **PLE is not optional.** Every layer in the model has a Per-Layer Embedding
   sub-block. We haven't implemented PLE, which means our current Gemma 4 forward
   may be missing this component entirely. Need to check if HuggingFace's default
   forward includes PLE or if it's LiteRT-specific.

## Appendix: ANE-Specific Optimization Opportunities

Additional findings from deep-dive into LiteRT patterns mapped to Apple Neural
Engine constraints. Ordered by estimated ROI.

### Tier S — High Impact, Implementable Now

#### S1. INT8 KV Cache (Bandwidth 50% Reduction)

**iOS 26 natively supports INT8 model I/O.** Verified via coremltools 9.0+:
`adjust_io_to_supported_types.py` adds `types.int8` to supported I/O types for
`target.iOS26`. iPhone 17 Pro runs iOS 26.

**Bandwidth savings:**

| Component | FP16 (current) | INT8 | Saving |
|---|---|---|---|
| chunk1 KV (7 SWA + 1 full) | 26.1 MB | 13.0 MB | 13.0 MB |
| chunk2 KV (5 SWA + 2 full) | 38.8 MB | 19.4 MB | 19.4 MB |
| Shared KV13 (read 2x) | 3.0 MB | 1.5 MB | 1.5 MB |
| Shared KV14 (read 2x) | 31.3 MB | 15.6 MB | 15.6 MB |
| **Total per decode step** | **99.1 MB** | **49.6 MB** | **49.5 MB (50%)** |

**Implementation path:**
1. Target `ct.target.iOS26` in conversion
2. Add MIL `dequantize(input=kv_int8, scale=calibrated_scale)` before attention matmul
3. Add MIL `quantize(input=new_kv, scale=calibrated_scale, output_dtype='int8')`
   before KV output
4. Scale is compile-time constant (per-head or per-layer, calibrated offline)
5. Swift: allocate KV cache as `MLMultiArray(dataType: .int8)` instead of `.float16`
6. IOSurface: use `kCVPixelFormatType_OneComponent8` (unsigned) with ZP=128, or
   standard `MLMultiArray(.int8)` (may lose zero-copy)

**Constraints:**
- `scale` must be compile-time constant (no adaptive per-token quantization)
- IOSurface zero-copy for int8 needs `kCVPixelFormatType_OneComponent8` (unsigned),
  signed int8 may require standard MLMultiArray fallback
- Google ships Gemma 4 with INT8 KV -- quality impact is acceptable

**Expected impact:** chunk2 (bottleneck) drops from 20.7ms to ~13ms. Total decode
from 67ms to ~52ms -> **~19 tok/s** (vs 14.9 baseline).

#### S2. Chunk3+4 Merge (Dispatch 4->3)

L15-34 are all Q-only KV-shared layers (no K/V projections). They are
computationally lighter per layer than L0-14. A 20-layer merged chunk may
compile on ANE despite the ~15-layer empirical threshold.

**Why this merge is safe:**
- No K/V projections -> fewer ops per layer
- Q-only attention reads shared kv13/kv14 (no per-layer KV I/O)
- Eliminates kv13/kv14 roundtrip between chunk3 and chunk4
- Prototype exists: `gemma4_lite_chunks.py` LiteChunk2 (L15-34)

**Current chunking reason:** ANE compiler hangs with 15+ layers per chunk
(`gemma4_stateless_chunks.py` line 5). But Q-only layers generate fewer MIL ops
than full KV layers, so the effective threshold may be higher.

| Config | Dispatches | Estimated saving |
|---|---|---|
| Current (4 chunks) | 4 | baseline |
| Merge chunk3+4 | 3 | ~5-10ms |
| LiteChunk1+2 (2 chunks) | 2 | ~15-25ms (risky: 15 layers in chunk1) |

**Expected impact:** ~5-10ms -> **~17 tok/s**.

### Tier A — Medium Impact, Requires Implementation

#### A1. Dispatch Pipelining (Pre-prepare Next Step Inputs)

Google's "sampler-driven pipeline" pattern: the sampler prepares next step's
input tensors (positions, masks) AND kicks off the next inference call, all
without a CPU round-trip.

**Current flow:**
```
ANE done -> CPU argmax -> prepare position/mask -> ANE dispatch (idle gap)
```

**Optimized flow:**
```
ANE done -> CPU argmax + parallel next-step input prep -> immediate ANE dispatch
```

Position is predictable (`current_step + 1`), mask is deterministic. These can
be pre-computed during the current ANE execution. Only the token embedding
depends on argmax output.

**Implementation:** In `ChunkedEngine.swift`, pre-compute next step's position
and mask tensors during the current decode. After argmax, only the embedding
lookup is needed before the next dispatch.

**Expected impact:** ~2-5ms/step.

#### A2. Single-Buffer KV Cache (Eliminate copyBack)

Google's `gpu_optimized_single_buffer_cache` pattern: same buffer for KV
input and output, with `param_tensor` indicating write position. Eliminates
the buffer swap and copy overhead.

**Current overhead:** `ChunkedEngine.swift` does `copyBack` (memcpy) of the
entire KV buffer after each chunk execution. At 8K context, this is ~99 MB
of copies per step.

**CoreML approach:** If the model uses `scatter_nd` or `dynamic_update_slice`
to write KV in-place, the same `MLMultiArray` can serve as both input and
output. No `copyBack` needed.

**Risk:** CoreML's ANE backend may require separate input/output buffers
(MLState was rejected for ANE -- error -14). Needs empirical testing.

#### A3. Async ANE Dispatch

Google uses event-based synchronization: all inference is async, CPU only
blocks when reading output for sampling.

**Verify our dispatch is truly async:** If `ChunkedEngine` calls
`prediction(from:)` synchronously, the CPU thread blocks for the entire ANE
execution. Using `prediction(from:options:completionHandler:)` or
async/await allows CPU work (next-step prep) to overlap with ANE execution.

### Tier B — Confirmed Not Viable or Already Done

#### B1. 2-bit Palettization

**Not viable without QAT.** Post-training 2-bit = quality collapse (proven
in `EXPERIMENTS.md`). Apple's own benchmarks show 2-bit barely faster than
4-bit on ANE (LUT decompression overhead). QAT requires multi-day GPU training.

#### B2. SWA Window-Only KV Read

**Already implemented.** SWA layers receive W=512-sized KV tensors, not full
context. The bandwidth bottleneck is full-attention layers only -> addressed
by INT8 KV (S1).

#### B3. Compiled Model Caching

**Verify `.mlmodelc` persistence.** Google caches compiled models (`.xnnpack_cache`).
CoreML equivalently compiles to `.mlmodelc`. Ensure this is persisted across
app launches -- recompiling from `.mlpackage` every time adds seconds to cold start.

### Combined Impact Estimate

```
Baseline:                    67.0 ms/tok = 14.9 tok/s @8K

+ INT8 KV (S1):             ~52 ms = ~19 tok/s  (+28%)
+ chunk3+4 merge (S2):      ~47 ms = ~21 tok/s  (+41%)
+ dispatch pipeline (A1):   ~44 ms = ~23 tok/s  (+54%)
+ MTP K=3 @60% acceptance:  44ms / 2.8 tok = 15.7 ms/tok = ~64 tok/s

Target: LiteRT-LM 56.5 tok/s -- achievable with S1 + S2 + MTP.
```

### Recommended Action Priority

| # | Action | Gain | Effort | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | INT8 KV cache prototype | +28% | 2-3 days (conversion + Swift) | iOS 26 target |
| 2 | chunk3+4 merge on-device bench | +10% | 1 day (LiteChunk2 exists) | None |
| 3 | MTP drafter integration | x2.8 | 3-4 days (Path A) | Blocker 2 resolved |
| 4 | Dispatch pipelining | +5% | 0.5 day Swift | None |
